# Project 1: AWS Data Analytic Platform Part 1

Objective

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing passenger survival, such as gender, age, class, and fare.
Dataset

The Titanic dataset includes details of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, such as:

    Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
    Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
    Age, gender, fare paid, and port of embarkation
