Surviving the Titanic: An Exploratory Data Analysis
Objective

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing passenger survival, such as gender, age, class, and fare.
Dataset

The Titanic dataset includes details of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, such as:

    Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
    Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
    Age, gender, fare paid, and port of embarkation

Methodology

    Data Cleaning:
        Handled missing values and corrected data types.
    Descriptive Analysis:
        Summary statistics and frequency distributions.
    Visualization:
        Histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to highlight trends.
    Survival Analysis:
        Explored survival rates by gender, class, and age.

Tools and Technologies

    Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration

Deliverables

    A Jupyter Notebook with:
        Data cleaning, visualizations, and insights
    Presentation summarizing key findings

Key Insights

    Women and children had higher survival rates.
    First-class passengers had a significant survival advantage.
    Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
